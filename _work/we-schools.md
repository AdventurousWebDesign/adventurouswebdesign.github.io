[Me to We Style][1] is (was) a social enterprise founded in 2007 by Oliver Madison
and Craig & Marc Kielburger. It has since become a part of "Me to We". Their
product lines of socially conscious clothing are produced in Canada with
eco-friendly fabrics.

In preparation for multiple "[We Days][2]". We worked together to augment capacities
of sales, marketing, and accounting staff. They would have to handle an
extraordinarily high volume of custom orders (bilingually) in a very short time
frame.

Cameron and Adventurous Web Design built us a very high-leverage tool to handle
the logistical challenge of fulfilling orders for so many We Day attendees.

*Listening first to the sales staff's existing workflows*, we zoned in on the
parts of the process that could be handled by a form. We hit on: personalized
sales proposition, data-input, payment-capture.

Freeing sales staff up tedious administrative work of order forms and invoices
was very encouraging! Working closely with the marketing team, we generated new
and untapped email lists from their CRM. Reaching their prospects at scale, and
with slick email templates garnered an extremely high response rate.

Over the course of the next 4 years, Me to We Style were able to reuse and
repurpose (even __internationalize__!) the system across an even greater number of cities,
students and school. This included We Day Events in 17 cities across the United
States, Canada, the UK and the Caribbean.

### This Application and Workflow Reached:

<div class="uk-grid uk-grid-width-medium-1-3" data-uk-grid-margin data-uk-grid-match>
  <div>10+ Cities</div>
  <div>6000+ Students</div>
  <div>300+ Schools</div>
</div>

Working with Me to We Style on this campaign and helping outfit all the
attendees meant something to us. We helped - in some small way - to make their
We Day experience as good as it could be.
