The [Academy of Culinary Nutrition][acn] administers the prestigious Culinary Nutrition
Expert course and grants the certification of the same name.

ACN is committed to WordPress, but dissatisfied with the selection of Learning
Management plugins for the platform. Together, we boiled down critiques of what
was available: "Too general", "Hard to customize", "Confusing admin screens",
"Lack of features", and "Breaks during upgrades".

Before going full green-field, we proposed modifying an off-the-shelf solution,
a comprehensive maintenance/admin package for their old LMS, and even bridging
their current site to an external service. While each solution had it's own
appeal, the only way to "have it all" would be to build from scratch!

This example is sort of "meta"; a glimpse of the plugin being used to to train the teaching assistants before they go on to help with the main course!
