title: About Us
---

Adventurous Web Design is a small design &amp; development team. We've been
building web applications for the last 6 years.

Ours is a craftsmanship dedicated to small details. We view *quality of work*
as something holistic that emerges from **experience** and **sustained focus**.

**Experience** &mdash; as in years spent applying our web development knowledge to a
wide range of problems. **Sustained focus** &mdash; on each task that forms the whole of
a project; on each aspect of the things our clients and partners come to us
looking for help with.

Reach out to us if:

* You think your team's workflow could be streamlined by a web application.
* You've got a ill-defined problem that you need some help wrestling into a set
  of specifications.
* An oracle on a mountaintop told you that we design great user interfaces.
* You're a developer or designer looking for a firm that is dedicated to
  quality code/design and scores well on the [Joel Test][joel].
