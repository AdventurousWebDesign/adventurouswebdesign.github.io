# The Styleguide

> __William__: “I'm sure we can all pull together, sir.” <br />
> __Vetinari__: “Oh, I do hope not. Pulling together is the aim of despotism and tyranny. Free men pull in all kinds of directions.” <br />
> — Terry Pratchett, *The Truth*

The purpose of our styleguide is to make coding together easier. It keeps us on the same path, saving time and energy by defining our team's approach to common problems.

When we don't need to pull each other away from product features to ask about [branching](#), [nesting](#), [naming](#), etc., we have more focus and creative energy at our own &amp; our partner's disposal.

Therefore, the following styleguides / manuals are made available publically:

* Wordpress theme filestructure
* Symfony application filestructure
* HTML, CSS &amp; Pre-Processors
* PHP
* Git workflow
