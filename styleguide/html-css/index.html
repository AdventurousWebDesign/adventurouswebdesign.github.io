# HTML, CSS &amp; Pre-Processors

These are our company guidelines &amp; best practices for writing HTML, CSS, and high-level strategies for CSS pre-processors.

## HTML
--------
General formatting

* Use soft-tabs with a two space indent. Spaces are the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any personâ€™s environment.
* Paragraphs of text should always be placed in a <p> tag. Never use multiple <br> tags.
* Even though quotes around attributes is optional, always put quotes around attributes for readability.
* Avoid writing closing tag comments, like `<!-- /.element -->`. This just adds to page load time. Plus, most editors have indentation guides and open-close tag highlighting.
* Avoid trailing slashes in self-closing elements. For example, `<br>`, `<hr>`, `<img>`, and `<input>`.

{% highlight html %}
<p class="line-note" data-attribute="106">
  This is my paragraph of special text.
