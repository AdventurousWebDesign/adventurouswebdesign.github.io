# HTML, CSS &amp; Pre-Processors

These are our company guidelines &amp; best practices for writing HTML, CSS, and high-level strategies for CSS pre-processors.

## HTML

### General formatting

* *Use soft-tabs with a two space indent*. Spaces are the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any personâ€™s environment.
* Paragraphs of text should always be placed in a <p> tag. *Never use multiple `<br>` tags*.
* Even though quotes around attributes are optional, *always put quotes around attributes* for readability.
* Always *add trailing slashes for self-closing elements*. For example, `<br />`, `<hr />`, `<img />`, and `<input />`.


{% highlight html %}
<p class="line-note" data-attribute="106">
  This is my paragraph of special text.
</p>
{% endhighlight %}
